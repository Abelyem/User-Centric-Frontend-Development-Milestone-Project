# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

What I have created is a website for a fictional band where the aim is to allow existing fans more access to the band, 
and any potential new fans information on who the band are, and additional options to find out more about them. 

The overall aim of the website is to assist the band in selling more music / tickets to their shows. 

## UX

<!-- Don't do from first person -->

The aim as mentioned above was to help the band sell more music / tickets. The website does this well in the way 
it has been set up. 

As a fan of this band, I want to know where they are touring, so that I can purchase tickets to see them live.  

As someone who has only heard of this band recently, I want to know more about their music, so that I 
can decide if they are a band I want to follow.

As someone who has never heard their music, I want to know what genre they fall under, so I can check to see if they are 
a band I could get into.  


## Features 


 ### Existing Features
- Smooth scrolling applied to html - allows page to travel smoothly when any of the navigation options are 
 selected (e.g Tour / About-us / Gallery), as opposed to jumping to the specific section selected.

- Header (fixed top)

   - Has a darker background compared to hero-image which allows the header to stand out, and all 
     information/links provided within to be clearly visible as font-colour is of a lighter colour.

   - Band name clearly visible, and also allows any visitor to the site easy navigation through the 
     site as access to all sections is always easily available (removes need to press ‘back’ or do any 
     additional work to visit a separate section of the site)

   - Social links constantly available for any new visitors to find out more, or existing members to visit 
     the band’s social media/go directly to stream their music via spotify/youtube. Data target set to 
     “_blank” on social links to ensure anyone visiting the site can remain there whilst opening up different 
     links for the bands social media/youtube/spotify. 
  
   - Highlight when hovered - both the navigational links, and the social media links within the header have 
     the hover feature applied which allows them to become a slightly lighter colour when hovered over to indicate
     to any user that they are clickable links. 

- Hero-image and Quote - the image of the microphone and quote within the hero-image quickly shows the website 
   is for a band (for those who are visiting for the first time/have not heard of the band before). For existing 
   fans (and in general for all visitors) the page is kept simple, and clean - not cluttered with information, 
   allows focus to remain on the header for navigation through the site.

- Tour section
   - Ticket links given a different colour (purple) to the rest of the text to indicate they are clickable - 
     also has the same hover feature allowing the link to change colour when hovered over, once again indicating
     that they are clickable links.

   - Date, venue and city all clearly shown in table format . Easy to identify when and where the band will be 
     performing in the future. 

- About-us section
   - Image shown directly below header in black and white / faces of band members not clear - image used to create 
     some mystery around the band members.

   - Information on the band provided directly below the image mentioned above. Also mentions type of music the band 
     makes, as well as links to the band’s first hit record, first album, and most recent album (to provide a general 
     overview as to how the band entered and became well known within the music industry, in addition to how they 
     developed within it (by sharing a link of their most recent album)).  

   - The band’s song and albums referenced  are given the same colour as the ‘Ticket’ links in the ‘Tour’ section of 
     the site, there is also a change of font-weight when hovered over. As this colour has been previously used to 
     indicate that text is a clickable link, this should indicate the same once again - font-weight would also go on
     to further point this out.

   - Video link provided directly below the information on the band - if none of the links were clicked, any user who
     has remained on the website will be able to listen to the band’s music whilst remaining on the site/continuing to
     scroll.

- Gallery section - A few images of the band whilst in action (either performing or preparing a set). 

- News section - allows fans to subscribe with their email address in order to receive any news/updates on the band
    (including but not permitted to future tour dates). The ‘required’ tag also added to the input tag for the email 
    address section to ensure email entered correctly.

- Footer - signals end of page, and also features band name and copyrights 


 ### Features left to implement 
- Subscribe to ‘news/updates’ section shown below ‘About-us’ section - may change background colour of that section 
  so it stands out and is not hidden/missed due to the video placed directly above the subscribe option
