# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.



## UX

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that
they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the 
following general structure:

- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc.
that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included 
as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online 
and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.


## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.


 ### Existing Features
 - Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, 
although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

 ### Features left to implement 
- Another feature idea
